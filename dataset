# Dataset Synapse
Synapse  is a multi-organ segmentation dataset and it is divided into three different folders: training, testing, and labels. The format
of these folders is nii.gz that is an open file format commonly used to store brain imaging data obtained using Magnetic Resonance Imaging methods. 
In order to unzip files is possibile to use the script 'niigz2png.py' that creates a folder for each of them uploading .png images. 
After this, given that the code of processing the data is not available, i wrote 'datapreparation.ipynb' following this guideline:
- convert the images to NumPy format
- clip the images within [-125, 275]
- normalize each 3D image to [0, 1]
- for training:
    extract 2D slices from 3D volume
- while for testing:
    keep the 3D volume in h5 format for testing cases 

niigz2png guide:
```python
   python3 .\niigz2png.py
```
